                    <p>
                        I had so much tension in my back. I did lots of yoga and massage but nothing was touching it. Then I started working with my eyesight. It was the magic key to releasing my body and my emotions. Working with my eyesight in tandem with my body and emotional work started the process of transformation I had been seeking.
