                    I use gentle movement, touch and dialogue to help people access a more immediate and tactile awareness of their eyesight. The work is holistic and embodied. I work through eyesight but I am aware and interested in how this work affects people physically, emotionally and spiritually. I teach how to bring relaxed flexibility into how we use our sense of sight. Through vision work I believe that we can become more aware of ourselves and the world around us. Bringing this awareness into our interactions with our families, communities and our environment can alter our experience of being.
