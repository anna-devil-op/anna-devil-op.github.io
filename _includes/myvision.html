                    In just opening our eyes we have access to a potentially overwhelming mass of information. What we choose to pay attention to and the awareness that we bring to that process, as individuals and as communities, is significant. With relaxation and movement practices grounded in the Bates method of vision education I invite a deeper awareness of eyesight to help people experience the best of their vision. I work through eyesight but I am aware and interested in how this work affects people physically, emotionally and spiritually. With movement, touch and dialogue I teach how to bring relaxed flexibility into how we use our sense of sight. My aim is to show people that we have choices in how we see. Learning how to look in a relaxed and attentive way can shift the quality of our vision. Through vision work I believe that we can become more aware of ourselves and the world around us. Bringing this awareness into our interactions with our families, communities and our environment can alter our experience of being.
