                    I use gentle movement, touch and dialogue to help people access a more immediate and tactile awareness of their eyesight. The work is holistic and embodied. I work through eyesight but I am aware and interested in how this work affects people physically, emotionally and spiritually. I teach how to bring relaxed flexibility into how we use our sense of sight. Through vision work I believe that we can become more aware of ourselves and the world around us. Bringing this awareness into our interactions with our families, communities and our environment can alter our experience of being.

                    Please join me in my explorations teaching embodied vision education. These classes are relaxing and perception enhancing helping you to move into your vision. My aim is that they will feel meditative. The classes will involve some stillness and some gentle movement. Each week we will explore a different visual theme, for example, colour, context, texture, depth, details and more.

                        I had so much tension in my back. I did lots of yoga and massage but nothing was touching it. Then I started working with my eyesight. It was the magic key to releasing my body and my emotions. Working with my eyesight in tandem with my body and emotional work started the process of transformation I had been seeking.

                    This workshop is for you if you are interested in natural eyesight improvement. Maybe you are a complete beginner who would like to get some grounding in what eyesight work is all about. Maybe you have had a few lessons or been to a workshop and are interested to find out more. Maybe you have lots of experience but want to get back to basics.

                <p>
                    The Bates Method is many things. At its heart is simplicity: the more relaxed we are the more we can see. It is a way to access our own perceptual capacity and can be used in a very practical way for natural eyesight care or as a spiritual practice. In this workshop we will cover the fundamental elements of the Bates Method. We will visit the topics of light, rest, movement, memory and imagination and learn how they relate to the philosophy and practise of this deep and powerful method.

                        Anna’s workshop was a revolution. What she gave me was a paradigm shift in how I think of vision. I was really amazed in the difference in my vision after the workshop. I see space and colour differently. It's a shift in consciousness for me to see seeing by itself for itself as a source of continual nourishment rather than just a pragmatic faculty.

                <p>
                    I grew up in Stirling, Scotland with mountains in sight and yellow broom growing in the garden. I had family and cats and a bike. I&#8217;d walk to school with my friends. We played in the lanes, climbed trees, stole plums. From the age of three I wore glasses and each year I would visit the optician and my prescription would increase and the lenses in my glasses would thicken slightly. At 18 I went to university in Cambridge, England to study physics. I liked its mathematical elegance and I wanted to understand &#8211; to get to the finest subatomic detail, to explore space and time. Still, each year my glasses would get stronger, my lenses thicker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating I moved to Montreal. My cousins there took me to an optometrist, Abraham Kirshner. This was a pivotal moment for me. “Your glasses are too strong”, he said. No-one had ever said that before. I was always just given stronger ones. But Kirshner was different. He gave me weaker lenses and some relaxation practices to do. My eyesight improved, I was astounded and set on my new path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in Scotland I found my teacher, mentor and support Aileen Whiteford and through her I discovered more about Vision Education and the Bates Method. Through my sessions with her many doors have opened for me and she accompanied me while I explored my natural vision for the first time. She introduced me to Meir Schneider and the many hours that I spent working with the Handbook of Self-Healing he co-wrote with Dror Schneider and Maureen Larkin opened up my body to me bit by bit. Aileen also showed me the International Conference for Holistic Vision. The first time I went was in 1997 in Germany and finding a community of people working with eyesight in a holistic and healing way was another dramatic moment for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1997 was also the year that I started at Glasgow Caledonian University Vision Sciences department researching holistic vision therapy. I spent time immersed in the world of optometry and opticians, learning how it all worked. I taught optics and conducted a clinical trial of vision therapy for myopia. It was a time when I had great freedom to pursue my interests but also great restriction in how I could communicate my findings academically. With compromises I graduated in 2001. Throughout this time my vision had been shifting and I had been reducing the strength of my glasses for a time and then not wearing them at all. My vision was very changeable but I was completely in love with the process of change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some years working in other fields in rewarding jobs I yielded to the call vision work still had for me. I went back to studying but this time in a practical way at the Bates College of Vision Education with Aileen Whiteford and Margaret Montgomery. I went deeper into the work and learned how to teach it. Since 2007 I have been practising vision education with individual clients and in workshops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As my vision changed so too did my body and my relationships with everything around me. I did Alexander technique, had cranio-sacral therapy, massage and counselling. I experienced lots of shifts in my body and in my perceptions. For me eyesight work is embodied work and I continue exploring and playing in different ways. I am grateful to all my Contact Improvisation teachers and fellow movers who have given me many tools for expression in relationship. I am also a student of Body-Mind Centring with Embody-Move and I love the open, creative, physical teaching space that provides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel a resonance with the field of embodiment. The trusting of our natural senses and coming home to the body as a radical act. I believe that vision is a vital link in this process. In the overwhelming mass of information that we have access to in just opening our eyes what we choose to pay attention to and the awareness that we bring to that process is significant. I am interested in the interconnectedness of all life and how patterns impact us and emerge from us. I am interested in creative expressions of health in individuals and communities.
